# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL is a much-needed approach for those who want to export data from one location to another or different environments.

ETLs are systems that have the ability to read different file formats and data types and transport them from one environment to another.

ETl serves to consolidate data from different sources and deliver it to a new environment. In addition, it can be used when a company switches from old to new systems.

An ETL also helps bring together all the data in a business, contributing to decision making.

## ETL Processes

- Extraction
- Transformation (or Cleaning)
- Data Load (or Delivery)

ETL are components that fit into the data pipeline.

An architectural example of ETL's in practice.
